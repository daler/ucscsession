:mod:`ucscsession` documentation
================================
:mod:`ucscsession` allows you to interact with the UCSC Genome Browser (and its
mirrors) from Python.  It takes inspiration from `rtracklayer
<http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/14/1841>`_, but tries to
do things in a more Pythonic manner.

To start, read through the :ref:`quickstart` to see the kinds of things
:mod:`ucscsession` can do.
